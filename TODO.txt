README
info about macros for debugging/printing: fxns will return false if fail. Up to user to check boolean flag. Can turn on errors if desired.
one day, make a ver of the project that reads all the key-val pairs into a hash map so only have to open file once, then search for vals using key?

FUTURE
untrack TODO.txt / delete it from repo
