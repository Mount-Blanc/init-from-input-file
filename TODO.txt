README
it's up to dev to make sure values in .inp are within range of var type and enough space is allocated for string var (so no seg fault)
info about macros for debugging/printing: fxns will return false if fail. Up to user to check boolean flag. Can turn on errors if desired.
one day, make a ver of the project that reads all the key-val pairs into a hash map so only have to open file once, then search for vals using key?

FUTURE
untrack TODO.txt / delete it from repo
